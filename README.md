## About The Project

For those new to speedcubing, it's a puzzle-solving challenge where cubers aim to solve the Rubik's Cube as quickly as possible. The objective is to align all the cube's colors correctly while racing against the clock for the fastest solve time. Achieving a fast solve time is the goal.

## What's the difference?

### Cool Stats
We like to find interesting data about you by extracting meaning from your training sessions, not like a conventional timer. 

### Metrics by cube
We have included what I called the **"Category Aggregation Principle."** To empower speedcubers to compute and analyze statistics not just for individual categories but also for each individual cube within the same category without affect or modify overall calculations. 

### No more DNF
Who likes? We won't cover calculations using DNF, instead delete the solve or add you a +2 penalty.

### Portability
Although our main emphasis lies in providing an exceptional experience for desktop training, we are actively working towards expanding this functionality to meet the requirements of mobile users.

### Modern design
Our user interface draws significant inspiration from Twisty Timer, aiming to deliver a comparable and user-friendly experience for desktop users.

This is what makes unique and versatile **Nexus Timer**.
