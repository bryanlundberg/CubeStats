## About The Project

For those new to speedcubing, it's a puzzle-solving challenge where cubers aim to solve the Rubik's Cube as quickly as possible. The objective is to align all the cube's colors correctly while racing against the clock for the fastest solve time. Achieving a fast solve time is the goal.

## Overview

This timer is carefully designed to keep track of solving times, giving valuable information and making the speedcubing experience even better. It's an essential tool for speedcubers who appreciate quality.

## What's the difference?

I have a passion for statistics and find immense value in extracting meaning from data. This process often unveils insights you may not have even been aware of. In pursuit of this goal, I have included what I called the **"Category Aggregation Principle."**

The core concept of the **Category Aggregation Principle** centers around the systematic consolidation and unification of statistical data from multiple items within the same category. This principle advocates for treating these data points as both a collective analysis and as a singular category simultaneously.

In practical terms, the **Category Aggregation Principle** empowers speedcubers to compute and analyze statistics not just for individual categories but also for each individual cube within the same category without affect or modify overall calculations.T his approach unveils valuable insights into a cuber's performance across a range of cubes, providing a comprehensive understanding of their skills and achievements within specific speedcubing categories. This is especially valuable for individuals looking to enhance their performance, monitor their progress and maintain a detailed history of their cube-solving journey with variations for cube, methods or both at the same time, without modify final category calculation!

> You can enjoy solving the **GAN 356 CFOP** cube using the **CFOP** method, and later switch to the **GAN 356 ROUX** cube, employing the **ROUX** method. After completing 10,000 solves, you'll still have accurate category calculations, including Best Time, Deviation, Mean, Ao3 - Ao1000, and more. Additionally, you can access specific and filtered detailed statistics for each cube, giving you a comprehensive understanding of your performance with the GAN 356 CFOP and GAN 356 ROUX cubes.

This is what makes unique and versatile **Nexus Timer**.
